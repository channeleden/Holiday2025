# Upload Sister's Image

To add your sister's graduation photo to the Flappy Bird game:

1. Save the graduation photo (with transparent background) as:
   `/Users/baileeeden/christmas-gifts/sister-golden-fur/public/sister-face.png`

2. Or run this command after saving it to your Downloads:
   ```bash
   cp ~/Downloads/sister-graduation.png "/Users/baileeeden/christmas-gifts/sister-golden-fur/public/sister-face.png"
   ```

3. The game is already configured to use this image!

The image should be:
- PNG format with transparent background ✅ (you have this!)
- Face centered
- Approximately 200x200px or larger

Once uploaded, rebuild and the game will use her face!
