# Quick Guide: Add Sister's Graduation Photo

## Step 1: Save the Image

Save the graduation photo (the one with transparent background and graduation cap) to:

```
/Users/baileeeden/christmas-gifts/sister-golden-fur/public/sister-face.png
```

## Step 2: That's It!

The game is already coded to use `/sister-face.png`!

## To Test Locally:

```bash
cd "/Users/baileeeden/christmas-gifts/sister-golden-fur"
npm run dev
```

## To Deploy to Netlify:

```bash
cd "/Users/baileeeden/christmas-gifts/sister-golden-fur"
npm run build
```

Then drag the `dist/` folder to https://app.netlify.com/drop

**The image should be:**
- PNG format ✅
- Transparent background ✅ (graduation photo has this!)
- Roughly square dimensions
